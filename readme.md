# Installing and configuring required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
\* If you want to use the derivative function (Implemented using Cython) :
```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

# Jupyter Notebooks
## dataset_csv_merge
This notebook process all .csv in orignal FEMTO dataset. For each bearing, it:
1. Merge all .csv files of acceleration
2. Merge all .csv files of temperatures
3. Removes μs from accelaration .csv files
4. Create folders for processed data

\* It also checks the .csv separator and use ',' separator in the merged .csv file 

(In original FEMTO dataset some files are separated by ',' and others by ';'). 

## data_processing
This notebook loads the bearing model with the specified data (.csv or binary) and compute the needed results for regression (cumsum, hankel matrix singular values and correlation coefficients).
It also process some other data analysis functions (fft, emd, rms, ...) which are commented. In the end there are some plots to see the results.

## regression
This notebook:
1. Loads cumsum and correlation coefficients
2. Define a bearing for training
3. Train a random forest model where X are the coefficients of a fitted polynomial in cumsum data and Y are an decreasing array (from 1 to 0) which size is the number of recordings from the explosion index (index where the correlation coefficient is bellow 0.95) to the end of life. 
4. Test in all bearings

# Analysing Code Performance - cProfile
```
python -m cProfile -o results.prof code.py
```
* You can use snakeviz to visualize the profiler results.

```
pip install snakeviz

snakeviz results.prof
```
